The file of interest here is `kernel7f7cc0ac71.ipynb`, a Jupyter notebook that details my rather inept attempt at the Facebook Deepfake Detection challenge.

In my defence, I was late to the party, it was my first ever go at a Kaggle challenge, I really didn't have the time to do this properly and I'm using a laptop. 'Cry me a river!' I hear you say. Fair enough!

I've mostly made this public for comedic value. And I may find some of the code useful at some stage in the future.

Unfortunately GitHub seems to be struggling to run the notebook, so you may need to clone the repo.
